Total value worker should make:
6600 usd x 6 = 39,600 usd

## Problem:

BTS price at the moment of creating worker was: 0,769230769 USD.
Even with protection of 2.5 multiplier BTS was always below a limit of  0,30 USD. This is the price needed to cover this worker as it was created.

Worker was for 6 months at 6660 usd per month.

## Transfers made inside this period:

We only pulled money from the worker 3 times:

alfredo-worker sent 4,800 USD to oxarbitrage.a699
1.11.151678027

alfredo-worker sent 3,000 USD to oxarbitrage.a699
1.11.167111927

alfredo-worker sent 5,998 USD to oxarbitrage.a699
1.11.196057968

Payments made until now:

6000 + 4800 + 3000 = 13,800

39,600 - 13,800 = 25,800 USD of debt today.

## Current vesting:

1,072.788 BTS - 1.13.1609 , 91.125 BTS - 1.13.1608 , 39,414.367 BTS - 1.13.4839
(around 40,000 BTS total in vesting)

If we buy usd today:
40,000 bts x 0,18(bts/usd price) = 7200 usd

Debt if we do that:
25,800 - 7,200 = 18,600

## Ending 2 weeks earlier:

means, 6600/2 = 3300 usd for the last month.

so instead of 39,600 the total for the worker is now 36,300 usd.

the 3 payments made:

6000 + 4800 + 3000 = 13,800

36300 - 13800 = 22200

assuming we buy 7200 usd today: 2200 - 7200 = 14,800
