# BitShares Core Release 2.0.171212

After the hardfork release and hardfork date passed, the bitshares core team haves enough updates for a new release. This release targets API nodes and we recommend them to upgrade. Block producer should keep in the hardfork release until we can confirm the new release is stable enough.

The most notorious changes are in the addition and update of plugins and some generix fixes. No consensus changes are present in this release and the upgrade is recommended to API nodes but optional.
