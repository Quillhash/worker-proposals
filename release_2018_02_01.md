The bitshares core team is proud to release a new bitshares-core version with the work done in the last 1 month period(approx). The release version has been tested by the majority of active bitshares witnesses and there is no report of problems.

All nodes are recommended to upgrade but the release specially targets API nodes. The nodes exposed to the internet are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible to avoid DoS attack fixed in this release.
